I made sure to use an each loop for this, as per Brook's recommendation this morning. I whiteboard with Mary, so the basic structure follows what we hashed out.

Advanced: 
The fb_advanced takes in maximum, modulo, and string variables. I suppose the assignment didn't explicitly state that maximum needed to be editable.
